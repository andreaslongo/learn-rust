= Rust Prototyping

Some quick notes taken from: https://corrode.dev/blog/prototyping

Workflow

. define requirements: draw, think about data flow
. add types: start with simple types
. borrow check: discuss your types with the compiler
. fix clippy lints: set it to the highest level possible
. go to step 1 (next iteration)

== Tips

* Use simple types: `i32`, `String`, `Vec<T>`, `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, ...
* Make use of type inference: defer the decision about types to later, like `.collect::<Vec<_>>()`
* Use the Rust playground
* Use `unwrap` liberally: `grep` them or use a clippy lint for later cleanup
* Add `anyhow` to your prototypes: Use `bail!` and `with_context`
* Use a good IDE: RustRover, VS Code, ...
* Use `bacon` for quick feedback cycles: `cargo install --locked bacon`, then run `bacon` in project dir
* `cargo-script` is awesome: Add a shebang `#!/usr/bin/env cargo +nightly -Zscript`, make the file executable and run it
* Donâ€™t worry about performance: Avoid early optimizations
* Use `println!` and `dbg!` for debugging
* Design through types: build up a vocabulary of concepts and own types which describe your system
* `todo!`: for sketching out the system
* `unreachable!` for unreachable branches
* Use `assert!` for invariants: `debug_assert!` for expensive checks which run at test/debug
* Avoid generics: until a clear pattern emerges
* Avoid lifetimes: `.clone()` for passing data around and `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for threading
* Keep a flat hierarchy: `main.rs` with nested `mod` until a good structure emerges
* Start small: defer perfection, sort out rough edges later. Paint the landscape, add details later.

== Clippy

[,console]
----
$ cargo clippy -- -D warnings
----

.main.rs, lib.rs
[,rust]
----
#![deny(clippy::all)]
#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]
// Optionally, if you want pedantic lints to also fail the build:
// #![deny(clippy::pedantic)]

= FizzBuzz

Write a function that takes positive integers and outputs their string
representation.

Your function should comply with the following additional rules:

* If the number is a multiple of three, return the string "Fizz".
* If the number is a multiple of five, return the string "Buzz".
* If the number is a multiple of both three and five, return the string
  "FizzBuzz".

Optional:

Add an extra Fizz or Buzz whenever one of the digits ('3' or '5') appears in
the number itself. So, '3' would become FizzFizz, '5' would become BuzzBuzz,
'15' would be FizzBuzzBuzz.

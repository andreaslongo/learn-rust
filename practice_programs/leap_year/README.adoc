= Leap Year

Implement a method that checks if a year is a leap year.

All the following rules must be satisfied:

* A year is not a leap year if not divisible by 4
* A year is a leap year if divisible by 4
* A year is a leap year if divisible by 400
* A year is not a leap year if divisible by 100 but not by 400

Examples:

* 1997 is not a leap year (not divisible by 4)
* 1996 is a leap year (divisible by 4)
* 1600 is a leap year (divisible by 400)
* 1800 is not a leap year (divisible by 4, divisible by 100, NOT divisible by
  400)

The method should return true if a year is a leap year, and false if it is not.
